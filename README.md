# Server
Code of servers

First of all, I feel the need to say that I'm not good in writing in english, but I want to improve, sorry about the mistakes I make.

I'm trying to do new servers. This is a new adventure, because I have only made servers in Ada, but it isn't the same, in that language I'have made chats (p2p and client-server) but I've never programed in HTML or PHP. Here begins my adventure.

First of all, I will install Apache2:
  sudo apt-get install apache2
It will be my base, when I finish my course in SAT (Servicios y Aplicaciones Telem√°ticas) with two of the best teachers I've even known, I will begin to program aplications with Django, a framework where programing in Python is easier.

Then, I install PHP5:
  sudo apt-get install php5

Well, after this you have to configure apache, there are plenty of tutorials over Internet and the only you need is to type in google: How to configure Apache

Ok! In this repository I'll put all the code of my web. Of course I'm not very good at programming neither the language, so if you find any mistake in my code or any improvement, LET ME KNOW PLEASE!

Thank you for all! =)
